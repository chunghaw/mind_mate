## üìä TESTING RESULTS

### Tooltip Testing
‚úÖ All tooltips display correctly
‚úÖ Mobile-friendly positioning
‚úÖ Smooth animations
‚úÖ Auto-hide works
‚úÖ Click-outside-to-dismiss works

### Chat Testing
‚úÖ Real-time AI responses working

**Example Chat Exchange:**
```
User: "I am feeling stressed about work today"

AI: "*responds in a gentle, caring tone*

I'm sorry to hear you're feeling stressed about work today. That can be 
really tough to deal with. Please know that your feelings are valid, and 
it's okay to take a step back and give yourself some time to recharge. 
Why don't you try taking a few deep breaths or going for a short walk? 
Small breaks like that can sometimes make a big difference. I'm here if 
you need any other suggestions for coping with the stress."
```
