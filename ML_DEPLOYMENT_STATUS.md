## üìã Testing Instructions

### Test the Backend

```bash
# Test calculateRiskScore
curl -X POST https://a5ttrfkhcr76hqo546gp3slfli0bkhlw.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"demo-user"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "riskScore": 0.XX,
  "riskLevel": "minimal|low|moderate|high|critical",
  "riskFactors": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T...",
  "interventionTriggered": false|true
}
```

### Test on Amplify

1. **Deploy to Amplify**:
   ```bash
   # Add files to git
   git add frontend/mind-mate-ml-simple.html
   git add frontend/ml-wellness-widget.js
   git add frontend/ml-wellness-widget.css
   
   # Commit
   git commit -m "Add ML integration demo page"
   
   # Push to trigger Amplify deployment
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Access the Demo Page**:
   - URL: `https://your-amplify-url.com/mind-mate-ml-simple.html`
   - Or set as index: Rename to `index.html`

3. **Test the Integration**:
   - Click "Calculate Risk Score"
   - Wait 5-10 seconds for feature extraction
   - View the risk assessment result
   - Check if intervention was triggered

## üéØ What Works Now

### ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Risk Calculation**
   - Extracts 49 features from user data
   - Calculates rule-based risk score
   - Classifies into 5 risk levels
   - Stores assessment in DynamoDB

2. **Intervention System**
   - Triggers for high/critical risk
   - Generates personalized messages (Bedrock Claude)
   - Suggests coping activities
   - Provides crisis resources

3. **Frontend Demo**
   - Test risk calculation
   - View results
   - See system status

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **No Historical Data Yet**
   - First run will show "No Data" or low risk
   - Need to log moods first for meaningful results
   - Use main app to log moods, then test ML

2. **No getRiskScore Endpoint Yet**
   - Widget can't auto-refresh yet
   - Manual calculation only
   - Can be added later if needed

3. **Demo User ID**
   - Each page load creates new user ID
   - For testing with real data, use consistent user ID

## üîß Integration with Main App

To integrate with your existing Mind Mate app:

### Option 1: Add Demo Page Link

Add a link in your main app:
```html
<a href="mind-mate-ml-simple.html">üß† ML Risk Assessment Demo</a>
```

### Option 2: Full Integration

1. Copy widget files to your main app directory
2. Add widget container to your main HTML
3. Initialize widget with your API URL
4. Update USER_ID to match your auth system

### Option 3: Separate Demo

Keep as standalone demo page for testing and showcasing the ML system.

## üìä Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Data (First Run)

**Action**: Click "Calculate Risk Score"

**Expected**: 
- Risk Level: "minimal" or "unknown"
- Message: "Insufficient data" or low risk score
- No intervention triggered

### Scenario 2: With Mood Data

**Setup**:
1. Use main app to log several moods
2. Include some low moods (3-4 out of 10)
3. Return to ML demo page

**Action**: Click "Calculate Risk Score"

**Expected**:
- Risk Level: Based on mood patterns
- Risk Factors: List of detected issues
- Intervention: Triggered if high/critical

### Scenario 3: High Risk

**Setup**:
1. Log multiple low moods (2-3 out of 10)
2. Log them over several days
3. Test risk calculation

**Expected**:
- Risk Level: "high" or "critical"
- Risk Factors: Multiple factors listed
- Intervention: Triggered
- Message: Personalized support message

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Data" or Low Risk Always

**Cause**: No mood logs in DynamoDB for the user

**Solution**:
1. Use main Mind Mate app to log moods
2. Use consistent user ID
3. Wait a few minutes for data to sync
4. Try calculation again

### Issue: Lambda Timeout

**Cause**: Feature extraction taking too long

**Solution**:
- Check CloudWatch logs
- Verify DynamoDB tables exist
- Check Lambda timeout settings (currently 60s)

### Issue: CORS Error

**Cause**: Browser blocking cross-origin request

**Solution**:
- Lambda Function URL has CORS enabled
- Check browser console for specific error
- Verify request headers

### Issue: Intervention Not Triggering

**Cause**: Risk level not high enough

**Solution**:
- Log more low moods to increase risk
- Check risk score threshold (0.6 for high, 0.8 for critical)
- Review risk factors in response
