2. **frontend/ml-wellness-widget.js** - Widget component  
3. **frontend/ml-wellness-widget.css** - Widget styles

---

## üéØ Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)

```bash
# Add files
git add frontend/mind-mate-ml-simple.html
git add frontend/ml-wellness-widget.js
git add frontend/ml-wellness-widget.css

# Commit
git commit -m "Add ML risk assessment demo"

# Push (Amplify will auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload

1. Go to Amplify Console
2. Select your app
3. Upload the 3 files to frontend folder
4. Trigger manual deployment

---

## üåê Access Your Demo

After deployment, access at:
```
https://your-amplify-url.amplifyapp.com/mind-mate-ml-simple.html
```

Or rename to `index.html` to make it the homepage.

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Open the Demo Page

Navigate to the deployed URL in your browser.

### 2. Test Risk Calculation

Click the **"Calculate Risk Score"** button.

**What happens**:
- Sends request to Lambda Function
- Extracts 49 features from DynamoDB
- Calculates risk score
- Returns result in 5-10 seconds

**Expected Result** (first time):
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "riskScore": 0.0,
  "riskLevel": "minimal",
  "riskFactors": [],
  "message": "Risk assessment complete: minimal risk level"
}
```

### 3. Test with Real Data

To get meaningful results:

1. **Log some moods** in your main Mind Mate app
2. **Include variety**: Mix of high and low moods
3. **Wait a moment** for data to sync
4. **Return to demo page** and calculate risk again

**Expected Result** (with data):
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "riskScore": 0.35,
  "riskLevel": "moderate",
  "riskFactors": [
    "Low average mood (4.2/10)",
    "Declining mood trend (-0.15)"
  ],
  "message": "Risk assessment complete: moderate risk level"
}
```

### 4. Test High Risk Scenario

To trigger an intervention:

1. **Log multiple low moods** (2-3 out of 10)
2. **Log over several entries**
3. **Calculate risk**

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "riskScore": 0.68,
  "riskLevel": "high",
  "riskFactors": [
    "Low average mood (3.2/10)",
    "3 consecutive low mood days",
    "High negative sentiment (65%)"
  ],
  "interventionTriggered": true,
  "message": "Risk assessment complete: high risk level"
}
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### First Run (No Data)
- Risk Score: 0.0
- Risk Level: "minimal"
- Risk Factors: []
- Intervention: No

### With Some Data
- Risk Score: 0.2-0.4
- Risk Level: "low" or "moderate"
- Risk Factors: 1-2 factors
- Intervention: No

### With Low Moods
- Risk Score: 0.6-0.8
- Risk Level: "high"
- Risk Factors: 3-5 factors
- Intervention: Yes

### Critical Situation
- Risk Score: ‚â• 0.8
- Risk Level: "critical"
- Risk Factors: 5+ factors
- Intervention: Yes + Crisis resources

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to extract features"

**Cause**: Feature extraction Lambdas not accessible

**Solution**: Already fixed! Backend is working.

### Issue: Risk score always 0.0

**Cause**: No mood data in DynamoDB

**Solution**: 
1. Use main app to log moods
2. Use consistent user ID
3. Try again after logging data

### Issue: CORS error in browser

**Cause**: Browser blocking request

**Solution**: 
- Lambda Function URL has CORS enabled
- Check browser console for details
- Try different browser

### Issue: Page not loading

**Cause**: Files not deployed correctly

**Solution**:
- Check all 3 files are uploaded
- Verify file names are correct
- Check Amplify build logs
