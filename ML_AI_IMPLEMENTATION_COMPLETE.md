## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Enhancements
```javascript
// Multi-service ML analysis
async addMLInterpretation(userText) {
    const [emotionAnalysis, sentimentAnalysis, riskAssessment] = await Promise.allSettled([
        this.analyzeEmotionsWithBedrock(userText),
        this.analyzeMessageWithComprehend(userText),
        this.calculateRealTimeRisk(userText)
    ]);
    // Combine and display results
}

// Comprehensive feature extraction
static async enhanceWithML(userId, basicData) {
    const [moodFeatures, sentimentFeatures, behavioralFeatures] = await Promise.allSettled([
        this.extractMoodFeatures(userId),
        this.extractSentimentFeatures(userId),
        this.extractBehavioralFeatures(userId)
    ]);
    // Generate ML-based insights and risk factors
}
```

### Backend Enhancements
```python
# Enhanced lambda handler with multiple analysis modes
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    if realtime_message:
        risk_data = analyze_realtime_message(user_id, realtime_message)
    elif provided_features:
        risk_data = calculate_risk_from_features(user_id, provided_features)
    else:
        risk_data = calculate_risk_score(user_id)  # Full ML analysis

# Real-time message analysis
def analyze_realtime_message(user_id, message):
    # Crisis detection, sentiment analysis, risk scoring
    # Returns immediate risk assessment without full feature extraction
```

- **Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, variance, min/max
- **Patterns**: Consecutive low/high days, volatility, decline rate
- **Frequencies**: Low mood frequency, high mood frequency
- **Temporal**: Weekend vs weekday differences, missing days

### Sentiment Features (14 features)
- **AWS Comprehend**: Negative, positive, neutral, mixed sentiment frequencies
- **Trend Analysis**: 7-day and 30-day sentiment trends
