# Requirements Document - Hackathon Demo UI

## Introduction

This spec defines the requirements for building a hybrid AI-first hackathon demo UI for Mind Mate. The goal is to create a compelling 3-minute demo that showcases both technical sophistication (ML/AI capabilities) and user experience (empathetic companion interface). The UI must highlight the unique value proposition: predicting mental health crises 3-7 days before they happen using 49 ML features.

## Requirements

3. WHEN displaying AI responses THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator before the message appears
4. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL store them in DynamoDB with proper structure
5. WHEN the chat loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve the last 50 messages from DynamoDB
6. WHEN AI generates insights THEN the system SHALL highlight technical terms (e.g., "AI analysis") in a different color

### Requirement 4: ML Insight Cards

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see AI-generated insights with confidence levels, so that I trust the recommendations and understand the data backing them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an insight is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a card with:
   - Insight icon (ðŸ§ )
   - Insight text (concise, actionable)
   - Confidence percentage
   - Number of data points analyzed
2. WHEN an insight card appears THEN the system SHALL animate it sliding in from the right
3. WHEN displaying insights THEN the system SHALL use a light green tinted background (#bbf7d0 with transparency)
4. WHEN multiple insights exist THEN the system SHALL stack them vertically with proper spacing
5. WHEN confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL display a warning indicator

### Requirement 5: Full AI Report Modal

**User Story:** As a technical judge, I want to see the detailed feature breakdown and 7-day prediction, so that I can evaluate the ML model's sophistication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "View Full AI Report" THEN the system SHALL display a modal containing:
   - Feature Analysis section (20 mood + 15 behavioral + 14 sentiment features)
   - 7-day risk prediction chart
   - Current risk score vs intervention threshold (60%)
   - Historical accuracy metrics
2. WHEN displaying feature analysis THEN the system SHALL group features by category with visual indicators
3. WHEN showing the 7-day prediction THEN the system SHALL display daily risk percentages in a chart format
4. WHEN the modal is open THEN the system SHALL allow closing via X button or clicking outside
5. WHEN feature data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show default values with a notice

### Requirement 6: Quick Actions Bar

**User Story:** As a user, I want quick access to common actions, so that I can efficiently log moods and trigger AI analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a quick actions bar with:
   - "Quick Mood" button (ðŸ˜„)
   - "AI Analysis" button (ðŸ§ ) - highlighted with gradient
   - "Activities" button (âœ¨)
2. WHEN the user clicks "Quick Mood" THEN the system SHALL show mood selection options
3. WHEN the user clicks "AI Analysis" THEN the system SHALL trigger the ML processing animation
4. WHEN the user clicks "Activities" THEN the system SHALL display activity suggestions
5. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL use pill-shaped design with icons

### Requirement 7: Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI to integrate with existing Lambda functions, so that real ML predictions and data storage work correctly.
