# Onboarding Implementation Status

## Current Status (as of now):

### ✅ Completed:
1. Welcome Screen
2. Google OAuth + Set Password
3. Personality Selection (4 options)
4. User Name Input
5. Pet Introduction
6. Backend: generateAvatar Lambda with Titan Image + guardrails

### ❌ Missing (from PRODUCT_VISION.md):
1. **Avatar Generation Screen** - After personality selection, before name input
   - Should show "Generating your unique pet..." with animation
   - Call `/generate-avatar` API
   - Display generated image or fall back to emoji
   - Option to regenerate if user doesn't like it

2. **Pet Naming** - Currently hardcoded as "Buddy"
   - Should either:
     - Let user name their pet, OR
     - Generate personality-based names

3. **Proper Flow Order:**
   - Current: Welcome → Auth → Personality → Name → Intro
   - Should be: Welcome → Auth → Personality → **Avatar Gen** → Name → **Pet Name** → Intro

## Next Steps:

### Option A: Full Implementation (30-45 min)
- Add avatar generation screen with loading animation
- Add pet naming screen
- Integrate Titan image generation
- Test end-to-end

### Option B: Quick Fix (10 min)
- Keep current flow
- Add "Generate Avatar" button on personality screen
- Skip pet naming for now (use "Buddy")

### Option C: Test First
- Test current onboarding end-to-end
- Then add avatar generation as enhancement

## Recommendation:
Given the time spent debugging, I recommend **Option C** - test the current flow end-to-end first to ensure everything works, then add avatar generation as a polished enhancement.

The backend for avatar generation is ready and working. We just need to integrate it into the UI flow.
