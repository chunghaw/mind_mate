# Mind Mate - AI-Powered Mental Health Companion

## Inspiration

Mental health challenges affect 1 in 5 adults, yet many face critical barriers: long wait times for professional care, stigma around seeking help, and most critically—the inability to recognize warning signs before a crisis occurs. We were inspired by a simple but powerful question: **What if AI could detect mental health crises 3-7 days before they happen?**

Traditional mental health apps focus on reactive support—helping after someone reaches out. But what about the people who don't reach out? What about detecting the subtle patterns that precede a crisis? That's where Mind Mate comes in.

We envisioned an AI companion that's always there, learning your patterns, understanding your struggles, and most importantly—**predicting when you might need help before you even realize it yourself**.

## What it does

Mind Mate is an AI-powered mental health companion that combines conversational AI with predictive machine learning to provide proactive mental wellness support.

### Core Features

### The ML Pipeline

Our risk assessment system analyzes three key dimensions:

$$\text{Risk Score} = 0.4 \times R_{\text{mood}} + 0.3 \times R_{\text{behavioral}} + 0.3 \times R_{\text{sentiment}}$$

Where:
- $R_{\text{mood}}$ = Mood pattern risk (7-day trends, volatility, consecutive low days)
- $R_{\text{behavioral}}$ = Behavioral risk (engagement decline, check-in frequency)
- $R_{\text{sentiment}}$ = Sentiment risk (negative language, crisis keywords)

Risk levels range from MINIMAL (0.0-0.2) to CRITICAL (0.8-1.0), with automated interventions triggered at each threshold.

### ML Model Development

We trained an ensemble model on synthetic mental health data with 49 features:

**Feature Engineering**:
```python
# Mood Features (16 features)
- mood_trend_7day, mood_mean_7day, mood_std_7day
- consecutive_low_days, mood_volatility
- weekend_mood_diff, morning_vs_evening

# Behavioral Features (18 features)  
- daily_checkin_frequency, engagement_decline
- response_time_trend, activity_completion_rate
- late_night_usage_frequency

# Sentiment Features (15 features)
- negative_sentiment_frequency, crisis_keywords
- hopelessness_score, isolation_keywords
- help_seeking_frequency
```

**Model Performance**:
- AUC: 0.83 (excellent discrimination)
- Recall: 0.79 (catches 79% of crises)
- Precision: 0.66 (66% of alerts are valid)
- F1 Score: 0.72 (balanced performance)

### Development Process

1. Architecture design and AWS infrastructure setup
2. Core Lambda functions and Bedrock integration
3. ML pipeline development and SageMaker training
4. Frontend development and real-time visualization
5. Integration testing and deployment optimization

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. **Real-Time ML Inference at Scale**

**Challenge**: Running ML predictions in Lambda with cold start constraints (<3s response time).

**Solution**: 
- Implemented feature caching in DynamoDB
- Optimized model loading with Lambda layers
- Used lightweight ensemble models instead of deep learning
- Result: Average inference time of 450ms

### 2. **Balancing Precision vs. Recall**

**Challenge**: False positives cause alert fatigue; false negatives miss crises.

**Mathematical Trade-off**:
$$F_1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$

**Solution**:
- Prioritized recall (catch more crises) over precision
- Implemented confidence thresholds for different risk levels
- Added "soft alerts" for moderate risk (suggestions vs. urgent warnings)
- Result: 79% recall with acceptable 66% precision

### 3. **Conversational AI Context Management**

**Challenge**: Maintaining conversation context across sessions while respecting privacy.

**Solution**:
- Implemented sliding window context (last 10 messages)
- Stored conversation summaries, not full transcripts
- Used Claude 3 Haiku's 200K context window efficiently
- Result: Natural conversations with <$0.01 per session cost

### 4. **Cold Start Performance**

**Challenge**: Lambda cold starts causing 5-10s delays for first requests.

**Solution**:
- Implemented Lambda SnapStart for Python functions
- Used provisioned concurrency for critical functions (chat, risk scoring)
- Optimized package sizes (removed unnecessary dependencies)
- Result: Cold starts reduced to <1s

### 5. **Data Privacy & Security**

**Challenge**: Handling sensitive mental health data while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

**Solution**:
- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3 + AES-256)
- No PII in CloudWatch logs (automatic redaction)
- Fine-grained IAM policies (least privilege)
- User data deletion capabilities (GDPR compliance)
- Result: HIPAA-ready architecture

### 6. **Cost Optimization**

**Challenge**: Keeping costs under $100/month for 1,000 users.

**Solution**:
- Used HTTP API instead of REST API (70% cheaper)
- Implemented DynamoDB on-demand pricing
- Optimized Bedrock prompts (shorter = cheaper)
- Used SageMaker spot instances for training (70% savings)
- Result: $52/month for 1,000 users
