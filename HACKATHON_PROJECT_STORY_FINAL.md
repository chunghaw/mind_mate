# Mind Mate - AI-Powered Mental Health Companion
## Project Story

## Inspiration

Mental health challenges affect 1 in 5 adults, yet many face critical barriers: long wait times for professional care, stigma around seeking help, and most critically—the inability to recognize warning signs before a crisis occurs. We were inspired by a simple but powerful question: **What if AI could detect mental health crises 3-7 days before they happen?**

Traditional mental health apps focus on reactive support—helping after someone reaches out. But what about the people who don't reach out? What about detecting the subtle patterns that precede a crisis? That's where Mind Mate comes in.

We envisioned an AI companion that's always there, learning your patterns, understanding your struggles, and most importantly—**predicting when you might need help before you even realize it yourself**.

## What it does

Mind Mate is an AI-powered mental health companion that combines conversational AI with predictive machine learning to provide proactive mental wellness support through a **real, production-ready ML pipeline**.

### The Real ML Pipeline

Our risk assessment system processes actual user data through three extraction pipelines:

**Risk Calculation Formula:**
$$\text{Risk Score} = 0.4 \times R_{\text{mood}} + 0.3 \times R_{\text{behavioral}} + 0.3 \times R_{\text{sentiment}}$$

**Live Feature Extraction:**
- **Mood Pipeline**: Analyzes actual mood logs for trends, volatility, consecutive patterns
- **Sentiment Pipeline**: AWS Comprehend processes real chat messages for crisis indicators
- **Behavioral Pipeline**: Tracks genuine usage patterns, engagement, and interaction depth

**Risk Levels**: MINIMAL (0.0-0.2) → LOW (0.2-0.4) → MODERATE (0.4-0.6) → HIGH (0.6-0.8) → CRITICAL (0.8-1.0)

**Solution**:
- Created dedicated demo user with realistic data
- Implemented demo bypass functionality
- Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- Multiple authentication paths (OAuth + demo mode)
- **Result**: Reliable demo experience with fallback options

### 5. **Cost Optimization at Scale**

**Challenge**: Keeping AWS costs under $100/month for 1,000+ users.

**Solution**:
- HTTP API Gateway (70% cheaper than REST API)
- DynamoDB on-demand pricing optimization
- Bedrock prompt optimization (shorter prompts = lower cost)
- SageMaker spot instances for training (70% savings)
- **Result**: $0.05 per user per month ($52/month for 1,000 users)

### 6. **Data Privacy & HIPAA Compliance**

**Challenge**: Handling sensitive mental health data with regulatory compliance.

**Solution**:
- End-to-end encryption with AWS KMS
- Automatic PII redaction in all logs
- Fine-grained IAM policies (least privilege)
- User-controlled data deletion
- Audit trails for all data access
- **Result**: HIPAA-ready architecture with comprehensive privacy controls
