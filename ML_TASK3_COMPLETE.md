# ML Prediction System - Task 3 Complete ✅

## Summary

Task 3 (Implement behavioral feature extraction) has been completed and deployed successfully!

## What Was Deployed

### Lambda Function: `mindmate-extractBehavioralFeatures`

**Status**: ✅ Deployed and Active  
**ARN**: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:403745271636:function:mindmate-extractBehavioralFeatures`  
**Runtime**: Python 3.11  
**Memory**: 1024 MB  
**Timeout**: 60 seconds  
**Code Size**: 25.5 MB (includes numpy)

## Features Extracted (15 total)

### Engagement Features (4)
- `daily_checkin_frequency` - Average interactions per day
- `avg_session_duration` - Average session length
- `engagement_trend` - Trend in daily interaction count (linear slope)
- `response_time_trend` - Trend in time between interactions

### Activity Features (2)
- `activity_completion_rate` - Proportion of mood logs with activities/tags
- `selfie_frequency` - Average selfies per day

### Communication Features (3)
- `avg_message_length` - Average length of mood notes
- `negative_word_frequency` - Proportion of negative words detected
- `help_seeking_frequency` - Proportion of help-seeking phrases

### Temporal Patterns (3)
- `late_night_usage` - Interactions between 11 PM - 5 AM
- `weekend_usage_change` - Weekend vs weekday usage difference
- `usage_consistency` - Standard deviation of daily interactions

### Metadata (3)
- `total_interactions` - Total interactions in period
- `mood_logs_count` - Number of mood logs
- `selfies_count` - Number of selfies

## Key Risk Indicators

The function detects behavioral patterns associated with mental health risk:

### High-Risk Patterns
- **Declining engagement**: Negative engagement trend slope
- **Increasing isolation**: Increasing response time between interactions
- **Negative communication**: High negative word frequency (> 0.2)
- **Help-seeking**: High help-seeking frequency (> 0.15)
- **Sleep disturbance**: Frequent late-night usage (> 5 in 30 days)
- **Low activity**: Low activity completion rate (< 0.3)
- **Erratic behavior**: High usage consistency variance

### Negative Word Detection
Scans for keywords: sad, depressed, anxious, worried, stressed, overwhelmed, hopeless, helpless, alone, lonely, tired, exhausted, angry, frustrated, scared, afraid, terrible, awful, bad, worse, worst, hate, cry, crying, pain, hurt

### Help-Seeking Detection
Identifies phrases: help, need help, what should i do, i don't know, advice, suggest, recommendation, what can i, how do i, struggling, can't cope, too much

## Data Sources

Queries two types of interactions from DynamoDB:
1. **Mood Logs**: Primary interaction type with notes and tags
2. **Selfies**: Secondary interaction type with emotion analysis

## Testing

Test via AWS Console:
1. Go to Lambda Console
2. Find `mindmate-extractBehavioralFeatures`
3. Test with: `{"userId":"demo-user","days":30}`

Expected output (for user with no data):
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": {
    "daily_checkin_frequency": 0.0,
    "engagement_trend": 0.0,
    "negative_word_frequency": 0.0,
    "total_interactions": 0
  }
}
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.4**: Extract behavioral features from interaction history  
✅ **Requirement 1.6**: Handle missing data gracefully with defaults  
✅ **Requirement 1.7**: Log errors without blocking the pipeline

## Progress Summary

**Task 1**: ✅ COMPLETE - Infrastructure deployed  
**Task 2**: ✅ COMPLETE - Mood feature extraction deployed  
**Task 3**: ✅ COMPLETE - Behavioral feature extraction deployed  
**Task 4**: 📝 READY - Sentiment feature extraction (next)

## Next Steps

Continue with Task 4: Implement sentiment feature extraction using AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis of user messages.

The behavioral feature extraction Lambda is now live and ready to analyze user engagement patterns!
