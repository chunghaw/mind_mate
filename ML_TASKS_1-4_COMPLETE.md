## Deployed Lambda Functions

| Function | Status | Memory | Timeout | Features |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| extractMoodFeatures | ✅ Active | 1024 MB | 60s | 20 |
| extractBehavioralFeatures | ✅ Active | 1024 MB | 60s | 15 |
| extractSentimentFeatures | ✅ Active | 1024 MB | 120s | 14 |

## AWS Services Used

- **Lambda**: 3 functions for feature extraction
- **DynamoDB**: EmoCompanion table for user data
- **Comprehend**: Sentiment analysis API
- **S3**: Model storage (ready for training)
- **KMS**: Data encryption
- **IAM**: Role-based access control
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring

## High-Risk Indicators Detected

The system can now identify:

### Mood Indicators
- Declining mood trends
- Consecutive low mood days (≥3)
- High mood volatility
- Low mood frequency > 0.3

### Behavioral Indicators
- Declining engagement
- Increasing isolation (response time)
- High negative word frequency
- Help-seeking behavior
- Late-night usage patterns

### Sentiment Indicators
- Increasing negative sentiment
- High negative sentiment frequency
- Despair keywords
- Isolation keywords
- Crisis keywords (suicide, self-harm)
- High hopelessness score

## Cost Estimate (Current)

For 10,000 users with daily assessment:

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|
| Lambda (3 functions) | $30 |
| Comprehend | $300 |
| DynamoDB | $40 |
| S3 | $5 |
| KMS | $5 |
| **Total** | **~$380** |

Note: This will decrease once we implement caching and optimization.

## Next Steps

### Task 5: Training Data Preparation
- Aggregate features from all 3 Lambdas
- Label data (crisis vs non-crisis)
- Create train/validation split
- Upload to S3

### Task 6: SageMaker Training Script
- Implement Random Forest + Gradient Boosting
- Feature importance analysis
- Model evaluation metrics

### Task 7: Model Training Orchestration
- Trigger SageMaker training jobs
- Monitor training progress
- Save models to S3

### Task 8: Real-time Risk Scoring
- Load trained models
- Orchestrate feature extraction
- Calculate risk scores
- Classify risk levels

### Task 9: Intervention System
- Generate personalized messages with Bedrock
- Deliver crisis resources
- Log interventions

### Task 10: Automated Daily Assessment
- Schedule daily risk assessment for all users
- Batch processing
- Summary reporting

## Testing the Feature Extraction

You can test each Lambda via AWS Console:

### Test Mood Features
```json
{
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "days": 30
}
```

### Test Behavioral Features
```json
{
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "days": 30
}
```

### Test Sentiment Features
```json
{
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "days": 30
}
```

Expected: Default values (zeros) for demo-user with no data.

## Documentation

- `ML_INFRASTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md` - Infrastructure details
- `ML_TASK2_COMPLETE.md` - Mood features
- `ML_TASK3_COMPLETE.md` - Behavioral features
- `backend/lambdas/*/README.md` - Individual Lambda docs

## What's Working

1. **Feature Extraction Pipeline**: All 3 Lambdas can extract features from user data
2. **AWS Integration**: DynamoDB queries, Comprehend API, S3 storage
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when data is missing
4. **Security**: KMS encryption, IAM roles, least-privilege access
5. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs for all functions

## Ready for Next Phase

With feature extraction complete, we're ready to:
1. Collect historical user data
2. Prepare training datasets
3. Train ML models
4. Deploy risk scoring system

The foundation is solid and ready for the ML training pipeline!
