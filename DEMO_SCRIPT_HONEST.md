## [0:00-0:30] Introduction & Onboarding (30 seconds)

**"Hi everyone! Meet Mind Mate - your AI companion for mental wellness.**

**[Open app: https://main.d3pktquxaop3su.amplifyapp.com/]**

Mental health challenges affect 1 in 5 adults, but most people don't get help until they're in crisis. Mind Mate changes that by detecting warning signs early.

**[Click "Sign in with Google"]**

Quick sign-in with Google - secure authentication through AWS Cognito.

**[Complete personality assessment - click through 3-4 traits]**

This personality assessment helps the AI adapt to YOUR communication style. Some people want direct advice, others prefer gentle suggestions. Mind Mate respects that.

**[Complete onboarding]**

## [0:30-1:15] Dashboard - Real-Time Risk Assessment (45 seconds)

**"And we're in! This is your wellness dashboard.**

**[Point to wellness score]**

See this wellness score? It's calculated in real-time by analyzing three things:

**[Point to each as you mention]**

**First - your mood patterns.** The system tracks your mood over the past 7 days, looking at trends, volatility, and consecutive low days.

**Second - your behavior.** Are you checking in regularly? Has your engagement changed? These are signals.

**Third - your conversation tone.** The AI analyzes sentiment - are you using more negative language? Any crisis keywords?

**[Point to risk level]**

It combines all three with a weighted algorithm - 40% mood, 30% behavior, 30% sentiment - to give you a risk level. Right now I'm at "Low Risk" - everything's stable.

**[Point to risk factors if any shown]**

And it tells you WHY. If your score changes, you'll see exactly which factors are contributing - maybe your mood is declining, or you're checking in less often. Transparency is key.

## [1:15-2:15] Chat - Your AI Companion (60 seconds)

**"Now let's talk to Mind Mate."**

**[Click Chat tab]**

This is powered by AWS Bedrock - specifically Claude 3, one of the most empathetic AI models available.

**[Type: "I've been feeling stressed about work lately"]**

Watch how it responds...

**[AI responds with empathy and follow-up questions]**

See? It's not giving generic advice. It's asking questions, understanding context. Remember that personality assessment? That's working behind the scenes - the AI adapts its tone to match how YOU communicate.

**[Type: "Yeah, I have a big presentation coming up and I'm worried I'll mess it up"]**

**[AI provides specific, personalized coping strategies]**

And here's what's powerful - every conversation is being analyzed. Not to judge you, but to understand patterns. 

**[Point to chat interface]**

If I start using more negative language over time, or if I mention feeling hopeless, the system picks up on that and adjusts my risk score. It's like having a companion who actually remembers and notices changes.

**[Scroll up if there's history]**

All your conversations are saved securely in AWS DynamoDB, so Mind Mate remembers what you talked about. It builds context over time.

## [2:15-2:45] AI Report - The Intelligence (30 seconds)

**"Now here's where it all comes together."**

**[Click AI Report tab]**

This is your personalized mental health report, generated by the risk assessment system.

**[Point to feature breakdown]**

See these bars? This shows what's contributing to your wellness score. For me, my mood trend is good, but my engagement has dropped a bit - I haven't been checking in as regularly.

**[Point to insights section]**

And here - personalized insights based on YOUR patterns. "Your mood tends to dip on Sundays" - the system spotted a pattern I didn't even notice!

**[Point to recommendations]**

Based on all this analysis, it gives specific, actionable recommendations. Not generic "exercise more" advice - but things tailored to MY patterns and MY personality.

**[Point to confidence/risk level]**

And it's transparent about the assessment - you can see your current risk level and what factors are driving it.

---

## [2:45-3:00] Closing - The Impact (15 seconds)

**"So that's Mind Mate - your 24/7 mental health companion.**

Built entirely on AWS - serverless Lambda functions, Bedrock for AI, DynamoDB for data, all running in the cloud. Scales automatically, costs pennies per user.

But more importantly - it's about catching problems BEFORE they become crises. The best time to help someone is before they hit rock bottom.

## Key Talking Points

‚úÖ **Real-time risk assessment** - Analyzes mood, behavior, sentiment  
‚úÖ **Intelligent scoring** - Weighted algorithm combining multiple signals  
‚úÖ **Empathetic AI** - AWS Bedrock Claude 3 for conversations  
‚úÖ **Pattern detection** - Spots trends you might miss  
‚úÖ **Personalized** - Adapts to your communication style

## If Asked About Machine Learning

**Honest Answer:**

"Great question! We've built a comprehensive risk assessment system that analyzes 49 different features - mood patterns, behavioral changes, sentiment analysis. 

Currently it uses an intelligent rule-based algorithm with weighted scoring. We've also developed machine learning models - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ensemble - that are ready to deploy. The infrastructure is there, the code is written, we just need more real-world data to train them for maximum accuracy.

The rule-based system is already quite sophisticated - it catches patterns and provides reliable risk assessment. The ML models will make it even better as we collect more data."

**What's True:**
- ‚úÖ 49 features analyzed
- ‚úÖ Weighted scoring algorithm
- ‚úÖ Real-time risk assessment
- ‚úÖ Pattern detection works
- ‚úÖ ML code is written and ready
- ‚úÖ SageMaker infrastructure deployed
- ‚è≥ ML models not trained yet (can be done in 15-20 min)

## If Asked About Predictions

**Honest Answer:**

"The system analyzes your historical patterns to assess your current risk level. If it detects declining mood trends, decreased engagement, or more negative sentiment, it flags that as increasing risk.

We're also building predictive capabilities - using the ML models to forecast patterns 3-7 days ahead. That's the next phase - giving you advance warning before things get tough. The infrastructure is ready, we just need to train the models on production data."

**What's True:**
- ‚úÖ Analyzes historical patterns
- ‚úÖ Detects trends (declining mood, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Flags increasing risk
- ‚úÖ Provides early warning
- ‚è≥ 7-day forecasting not yet implemented

## If Asked About Chat History

**Honest Answer:**

"Yes! All conversations are saved securely in AWS DynamoDB. The AI can access your conversation history to maintain context across sessions. It remembers what you talked about and builds understanding over time."

**What's True:**
- ‚úÖ Chat history IS saved
- ‚úÖ Stored in DynamoDB
- ‚úÖ Retrieved for context
- ‚úÖ Persistent across sessions
