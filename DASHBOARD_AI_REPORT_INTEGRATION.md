# ✅ Dashboard & AI Report Integration Complete!

## What Was Fixed

The Dashboard and AI Report were showing static placeholder data and weren't connected to the real ML risk calculation system. Now they display **real-time risk assessments** based on actual user data.

---

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Added APIClient
**Location**: `frontend/mind-mate-hackathon.html` (after configuration section)

```javascript
const APIClient = {
    async calculateRisk(userId) {
        // Calls /risk/calculate endpoint
        // Returns real risk data from ML system
    },
    
    async getRiskAssessment(userId) {
        // Gets latest assessment or calculates new one
    }
};
```

### 2. Updated Dashboard Loading
**Function**: `loadWellnessData()`

**Now displays**:
- ✅ Real wellness score (calculated from risk score)
- ✅ Actual risk level (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- ✅ Real ML confidence percentage
- ✅ Actual number of features analyzed
- ✅ Risk factors detected

**Before**: Static values (49 features, 94% confidence, LOW risk)  
**After**: Dynamic values from `calculateRiskScore` Lambda

### 3. Created AI Report View
**Function**: `updateAIReport()`

**Displays**:
- 🎯 Risk score with color-coded indicator
- 📊 Features analyzed and ML confidence
- ⚠️ List of detected risk factors
- 💡 Personalized recommendations
- 🆘 Crisis resources (if high/critical risk)

### 4. Auto-Refresh on Crisis Keywords
**Function**: `sendMessage()`

**Detects crisis keywords**:
- suicide
- kill myself
- end it
- die
- hopeless
- worthless

**When detected**:
- Automatically refreshes risk assessment after 2 seconds
- Updates Dashboard and AI Report with new data
- Shows updated risk level and factors

### 5. Tab Switching Updates
**Function**: `switchTab()`

**Now**:
- Dashboard tab: Refreshes wellness data
- AI Report tab: Updates report with latest data
- Chat tab: No changes (already working)

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### User Journey

```
1. User chats: "I feel hopeless and want to die"
   ↓
2. Bedrock Agent responds with crisis support
   ↓
3. Crisis keyword detected → Triggers risk calculation
   ↓
4. calculateRiskScore Lambda analyzes:
   - Mood features
   - Behavioral features  
   - Sentiment features (detects crisis keywords!)
   ↓
5. Risk score calculated: 0.85 (CRITICAL)
   ↓
6. Dashboard updates automatically:
   - Wellness Score: 1.5/10
   - Risk Level: CRITICAL
   - Features: 49 analyzed
   - Confidence: 87%
   ↓
7. AI Report shows:
   - 🚨 Critical risk indicator
   - Crisis keywords detected
   - 988 hotline prominently displayed
   - Immediate support recommendations
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Integration

1. **Open the app** and go to Chat tab
2. **Send a crisis message**: "I want to commit suicide"
3. **Wait 2 seconds** for auto-refresh
4. **Switch to Dashboard tab** → Should show HIGH/CRITICAL risk
5. **Switch to AI Report tab** → Should show:
   - High risk score
   - Crisis keywords in risk factors
   - 988 hotline displayed
   - Urgent recommendations

### Expected Results

**Dashboard**:
- Wellness Score: Low (1-3/10)
- Risk Level: HIGH or CRITICAL
- Features Analyzed: 49
- ML Confidence: 85-95%

**AI Report**:
- 🚨 Red/yellow risk indicator
- Risk score: 60-90%
- Risk factors list includes "Crisis keywords detected"
- Crisis resources prominently displayed
- Urgent recommendations
